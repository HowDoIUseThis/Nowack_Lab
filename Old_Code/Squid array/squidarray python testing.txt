PCS = PCSquid software for the PCI100/PFL102
SAP = squidarray.py, based on OpenSQUID, for the PCI100/PFL102

=== Setting values of everything ===
A-bias: with pin 11 oscilloscope, pin 14 ground
PCS: 10 uA array bias is ~-1 V
SAP: pfl.A_bias = 10e-6 works, can return to zero as well
PCS: 100 uA array bias (limit) is ~-9 V
SAP: pfl.A_bias = 100e-6 works
PCS limits 100 uA as maximum
SAP caps it as well
PCS doesn't allow negative
SAP brings it to zero

A-flux: with pin 12 oscilloscope, pin 13 ground (reverse did nothing!)
PCS: 200 uA array flux is ~-1.55 V
SAP: pfl.A_flux = 200e-6... didn't work
FIXED: S-flux and A-flux control registers were swapped (0x0000 correct for SQUID flux, 0x0001 correct for Array flux)
Limits are correct

Tried setting A-flux, then A-bias. A-flux value remained. :)

S-bias: with pin 4 oscilloscope pin 5 ground
PCS: 100 uA S bias is ~-0.5 V, 2mA is ~-10 V
SAP: pfl.S_bias = 100e-6 and 2e-3 did as expected
limits work

S-flux: with pin 9 oscilloscope, pin 10 ground
PCS: 10 uA is ~0.5 V, 100 uA is ~5 V (why not maxed?)
SAP: pfl.S_flux = 10e-6, 100e-6

Offset: looking at WB output with oscilloscope
PCS: at zero offset, maxed at 10 V, bring to 0V with -2.5852 mV offset
SAP: pfl.offset = -2.5852e-3 works!
limits also work. Pretty sure this works.

=== Heater ===
looking at pin 6, ground 7.
SAP: with pfl.heat(), saw blip (0.2 seconds of heating only, hard to see!)
slowing down oscilloscope helped
1 second heat was perfectly flat over time, voltage at 9.8 V-ish
PCS: see similar thing.

Heating should zero everything, right?
PCS: looking at A-bias & offset : zeroed only when cooling; 
SAP: A-bias and offset stay on during entire heat-cool cycle
After code edited:
PCS: test signal does not drop when heating
SAP: test signal drops from 10V to -10V when heating - this is because I originally had set to zero as well, don't want this! especially if locked!
SAP: all parameters zeroed while cooling

PCS: test signal stays on during heating, switches off during cooling - I'll just disable it for full cycle


=== TEST SIGNAL ===
Monitoring test signal sent to array-flux
changed sensitivity to low, med, high
PCS: amplitude increases low, med, high - looks like some RC for high most pronounced
SAP: same thing! cap, resistor setter functions work, as well as sensitivity function!
PCS: test signal off: output goes to zero
SAP: works! check later for auto

Monitor a-bias - no RC, amplitude doesn't change with sens. All good!
Monitor s-flux - RC, ampliutude doesn't change, all good
Monitor S-bias - same as a-bias

Test heater: test signal turned off for both heating and cooling cycles

=== Normal operation ===
Ready for normal operation tests: make sure to try test signal auto and reset integrator

Looks promising! Heater needed a quick change: restore parameter values, and then reset integrator. Or else the array falls out of lock.

**Changed name of unlock function to tune

Test signal on, auto, off works as expected
Integrator reset works fine.
Sensitivity change works
Test input works as well

All tests done with just array, but SQUID should work the same

**Changed parameter units to uA/mV. Writing e-6 all the time got annoying
