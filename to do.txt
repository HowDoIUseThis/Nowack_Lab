Once have conversion factors, have touchdown "hone in" on center of piezo range better. Right now attocubes will miss.
	-If change direction multiple times, reduce attocube number of steps
Build in all conversion factors
Read temperature of Montana
Read high voltage amplifier gain

SAVE EVERYTHING

Touchdown with floating table


Try capacitance in X, get calibration, see if dip occurs
Use center point of plane for fitting, and maybe use this also to update/set C value?

reset squid before each scan
initialize squidarray object without zeroing PFL - impossible? No way of reading values
walkthrough function tune and lock squid/array
Array class that deals with pci, pfl.
	-Auto tune function would be cool

Scanning procedure:
	add squid relock
	add temperature checking before and after scan
	Figure out rates
	Fine over one direction, coarse over other
	Look at sweep rate as a function of number of points
	Change scan direction
