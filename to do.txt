Once have conversion factors, have touchdown "hone in" on center of piezo range better. Right now attocubes will miss.
	-If change direction multiple times, reduce attocube number of steps
Build in all conversion factors
Read temperature of Montana

SAVE EVERYTHING

Touchdown with floating table

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
Figure out matplotlib notebook

In preamp driver (and others), only set values if they change
=======
test daq sweep accel - kind of pointless right now, need to fix.
>>>>>>> Stashed changes


Try capacitance in X, get calibration, see if dip occurs
Use center point of plane for fitting, and maybe use this also to update/set C value?

reset squid before each scan
initialize squidarray object without zeroing PFL - impossible? No way of reading values
walkthrough function tune and lock squid/array
Array class that deals with pci, pfl.
	-Auto tune function would be cool

Scanning procedure:
	add squid relock
	Figure out rates
	Look at sweep rate as a function of number of points
	Fine over one direction, coarse over other

	Change scan direction (arbitrary scan angle???)
		Need to try swap as-is and go from there. 
		Would be good to get x/y straight when swapped vs not
		Also would be good to “un-rotate” a scan to see which direction need to move with attocubes
