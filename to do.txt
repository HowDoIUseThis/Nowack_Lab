Once have conversion factors, have touchdown "hone in" on center of piezo range better. Right now attocubes will miss.
	-If change direction multiple times, reduce attocube number of steps
Build in all conversion factors
Read temperature of Montana
Read high voltage amplifier gain
Array class that deals with pci, pfl.
	-Auto tune function would be cool
Data file name in plots, timestamps in notebook?
SAVE EVERYTHING

Touchdown with floating table
CHECK PIEZO RANGES BEFORE DOING SCAN

Update plane c value with touchdown
Fine over one direction, coarse over other
Look at sweep rate as a function of number of points

Check plane when update any of a, b, c. Make sure piezos still in range!
Try capacitance in X, get calibration, see if dip occurs
Use center point of plane for fitting, and maybe use this also to update/set C value?

Reusing touchdown function, local variable i referenced before assignment?
