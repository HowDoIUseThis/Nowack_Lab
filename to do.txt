Fix preamp timeout error
Notes at the end of the measurement

Allow for instruments = None to make an object with the same plotting, data saving/loading capabilities but without having to use the same instruments in two places


Save data while measurement in progress - test with mod2D?

When reading files that are open for writing, copy the file and load temp copy


Find location of Nowack_Lab module and figure out paths from there

directory_of_this_module = os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__))




Once have conversion factors, have touchdown "hone in" on center of piezo range better. Right now attocubes will miss.

	-If change direction multiple times, reduce attocube number of steps

Build in all conversion factors

Read temperature of Montana


SAVE EVERYTHING


Touchdown with floating table

<<<<<<< HEAD



Figure out matplotlib notebook


In preamp driver (and others), only set values if they change

test daq sweep accel - kind of pointless right now, need to fix.

>>>>>>> origin/master

Try capacitance in X, get calibration, see if dip occurs

Use center point of plane for fitting, and maybe use this also to update/set C value?


reset squid before each scan

initialize squidarray object without zeroing PFL - impossible? No way of reading values

walkthrough function tune and lock squid/array

Array class that deals with pci, pfl.
	
-Auto tune function would be cool


Scanning procedure:
	
add squid relock
	
Figure out rates
	
Look at sweep rate as a function of number of points
	
Fine over one direction, coarse over other

	Change scan direction (arbitrary scan angle???)
		
Need to try swap as-is and go from there. 
		
Would be good to get x/y straight when swapped vs not
		
Also would be good to “un-rotate” a scan to see which direction need to move with attocubes
