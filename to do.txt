Once have conversion factors, have touchdown "hone in" on center of piezo range better. Right now attocubes will miss.
	-If change direction multiple times, reduce attocube number of steps
Build in all conversion factors
Read temperature of Montana
Read high voltage amplifier gain

SAVE EVERYTHING

Touchdown with floating table

Fine over one direction, coarse over other
Look at sweep rate as a function of number of points
Change scan direction

Try capacitance in X, get calibration, see if dip occurs
Use center point of plane for fitting, and maybe use this also to update/set C value?

reset squid before each scan
initialize squidarray object without zeroing PFL - impossible? No way of reading values
walkthrough function tune and lock squid/array
Array class that deals with pci, pfl.
	-Auto tune function would be cool

##### Done, need to test: ######
Reusing touchdown function, local variable i referenced before assignment?
Update plane c value with touchdown
Check plane when update c. Make sure piezos still in range!
Data file name in plots, timestamps in notebook?
save scan and capacitance individually
